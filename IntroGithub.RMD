```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)


```

## Why Use Github?


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%', fig.show='hold', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('./cartoon.png', auto_pdf = FALSE)
```    

## Why Use Github?

- Data analysis produces many files!
- $\color{blue}{\text{Structure:}}$ Github allows for version control via a tree structure
- $\color{blue}{\text{Organization:}}$ You can sync your files to Github from multiple computers
- $\color{blue}{\text{Backup:}}$ Copies of your files are stores online
- $\color{blue}{\text{Reproducibility/Transparency:}}$ Anyone can access your code to learn how you did things
- $\color{blue}{\text{Collaborations:}}$ Multiple authors can work on the same file 


## Some Terminology

- $\color{blue}{\text{Repository/Repo}}$--- a directory
- $\color{blue}{\text{Master}}$ --- the main version of the file
- $\color{blue}{\text{Branch}}$ --- a copy of the master where you can make changes without changing the master
- $\color{blue}{\text{Fork}}$ --- a copy of someone else's repository
- $\color{blue}{\text{Commit}}$ --- save changes
- $\color{blue}{\text{Stage}}$ --- prepare files for uploading to Github
- $\color{blue}{\text{Pull/Push}}$ --- download/upload any changes from/to Github to/from your computer

## Set Up:

- [This](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) is a great reference source.
- Make sure you have a Github account, Rstudio, and [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or macOS (Install the Xcode command line tools)
- Close and reopen Rstudio, go to `Tools`>`Shell` (may have to go to `Tools`>`Global Options`>`Git` and configure the path to `bin/git.exe` first) 
- Configure git with your user name and email (https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)

## Let's Try It

- Copy my repo's (IntroGithub) HTTPS clone URL to your clipboard via the green “Clone or Download” button
- In Rstudio start a new Project: `File > New Project > Version Control > Git`
- In the “repository URL” paste the URL of your new GitHub repository

## Create You Own Branch to Work In
- In the shell, type: `git branch yourname`
- Now you can switch to your brach (upper right corner) and edit the file without affecting the master.
- Switch to your branch, make some edits, save them
- To have Github track your branch, open the shell and type `git push -u origin your_branch_name`
- Now you can Pull/Push your branch (always Pull before your Push).

## Daily Workflow

- Once your project or a part of it works (e.g., a script produces an output without errors), stage your changes and make a commit
- Enter a meaningful commit message (e.g. "WIP" for "work in progress")
- Do some more work, make sure the project still works, make another commit, but this time check the 'amend the previous commit' box
- Once you are ready to share your progress with others, commit amending again, but enter a meaningful commit message. Push. 

# Congratulations! You are an expert in Github!
